Best conceivable runtime (BCR)

The best conceivable runtime is, literally, the best runtime you could conceive of a solution to a problem
having. You can easily prove that there is no way you could beat the BCR.

Example: find a sum of array elements, the best way to do is O(N), you need to iterate through all elements

Note that the best conceivable runtime is not necessarily achievable. It says only that you can't do better
